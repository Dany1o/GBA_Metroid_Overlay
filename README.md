# GBA_Metroid_Overlay

Overlay for RetroArch Android designed to make GBA Metroid games playable via touch controls.

Based on "flat" assets from the standard library.

Physical controller will be always a better experience, but this is a viable option if you cannot carry one.

Tested only in Zero Mission (completed Normal and Hard mode, not 100%) but will probably work in Fusion as well.

*Only 2 thumbs are required to play.*
- **R+b button** - fire missiles/power bombs;
- **L+up** - aim diagonally upwards;
- **L+down** - croutch + aim diagonally downwards;
- **Slide from L+up to L+down** - aim diagonally downwards;
- **Slide from L+down to L+up** - croutch + aim diagonally upwards;
- To aim upwards/downwards while moving, use **diagonal D-pad directions**.

Keep in mind: it was designed for 16:9 aspect ratio. On newer phones with wider screen it might appear different.
